                                                      This game is yet to be finished.
                                  Keys: W and S for the left paddle movement and D for special ability.
                            Arrow-up and Arrow-down for the right paddle movement and arrow-right for special ability.
             Please use the ESC button to exit the game instead of clicking the red arrow as it does not work while the game is running

Things that are going to be added: 
•	A main menu with a soundtrack playing.
•	A panel for a tutorial on the player keys.
•	The option to select more than one game.
•	NEW GAME with similar mechanics to Pong.
•	Hopefully two players over the internet one day.
